Vertical Search Engine
=========
This project is one of the project I finished for class CS6200 Information Retrival. The function of it is that the application can render
the webpages that related to user queries.
The Elasticsearch server contained information of 40,000 webpages that related to the topic: the immigration history of United State.
When user input a piece of query, the application will return the most related result (web pages) and display on the left pane.
The final result of the project is deployed on Google Cloud Platform for demonstration.
